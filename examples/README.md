# aerobase-angular examples

Examples to help you setup the library in your application.

* [aerobase-heroes](https://github.com/aerobase/aerobase-angular/tree/master/examples/aerobase-heroes): This app shows a simple configuration. It's consuming an external REST API service from [Open Dota](https://docs.opendota.com/), but it should give you an idea of a basic setup.
* [aerobase-events](https://github.com/aerobase/aerobase-angular/tree/master/examples/aerobase-events): Shows how to handle the aerobase events: onReady, onAuthSuccess, onAuthError, onAuthRefreshSuccess, onAuthRefreshError, onAuthLogout, onTokenExpired. It uses a public REST API from [restcountries](http://restcountries.eu/).
